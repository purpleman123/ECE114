// workshop4_2_template.c: Reversing the digits of a positive integer
/*
 Write a C program that accepts a positive five-digit integer input, reverses the digits, and displays it to the user. Your program must have an input validation that checks if the entered value is a five-digit integer between 10000 and 99999 (09999 is not valid!). If the input is wrong, your program needs to ask the user to enter again. You have to write a function, called reverse, that can get each digit and print out the reversed number. The reversed number also needs to have five digits. Think about how to do it! Donâ€™t forget to clear the input buffer! There are several solutions. You may need to use modulo operators and integer division. Write pseudo code first and convert it to a C program.

 The reverse function prototype is:
 void reverse(int inputNum);

 Your program should be able to output as follows:

 Sample output #1:
 Please enter a 5-digit positive integer: 13579
 The reverse of 13579 is 97531!

 Sample output #2:
 Please enter a 5-digit positive integer: OneTwoThreeFour
 Wrong input! Enter a 5-digit positive integer: 1234
 Wrong input! Enter a 5-digit positive integer: 10000
 The reverse of 10000 is 00001!

 Sample output #3:
 Please enter a 5-digit positive integer: 100000
 Wrong input! Enter a 5-digit positive integer: 9999
 Wrong input! Enter a 5-digit positive integer: 98765
 The reverse of 98765 is 56789!
